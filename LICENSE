-- 1. Where this LICENSE applies --

The LICENSE applies to the CODE wherever it is used.
If you modify the CODE for your usage, the LICENSE still applies.
- 1.a Marking used sections -
The CODE section used must be marked clearly. You may not declare you made it,
and you must link to the LICENSE from it.
- 1.b Cheating -
You can't say you used up to a specific part of my code, unmark it as LICENSE'd, 
change it, and mark the rest as LICENSE'd. That falls under modifying, 
and the changed code is still covered by the LICENSE.

-- 2. How you can use the CODE --

You may use this CODE in open-source projects freely (within the rest of the rules).
You may use it in closed-source projects if you give US credit.
Using the CODE dosen't forfeit you from licensing
